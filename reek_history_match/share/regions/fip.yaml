# This is an example on how to connect a FIP-region set like FIPNUM from Eclipse to inplace groups
# like REGION or ZONE in this example.
FIPNUM:
  groups: # The groups you want to make
    REGION:
      # The key specifies the sub groups (can be numbers or text).
      # The values are the FIP (e.g. FIPNUM) regions to associate with the sub group
      1: [1, 3, 5]
      2: [2, 4, 6]
    ZONE:
      UpperReek: [1, 2]
      MidReek: [3, 4]
      LowerReek: [5, 6]

# You may add several FIP sets in the same file
